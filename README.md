## 📊 Projects with Personal Contributions
Below are some projects I served as a primary contributor on:

### [Sports Auto-Commentator AI](https://github.com/dsu-cs/csc702_fall2025/tree/main/Video_and_Audio/LucasSamuel)
* **Description:** A complete vision-to-audio AI pipeline to generate play-by-play football commentary from silent video clips. 
* **My Contribution:** Engineered a CLIP Computer Vision architecture to be compared with others, and automatic scriptwriting and voice synthesis using Gemini Flash and Bark TTS.
* **Tech:** Python, PyTorch, MoviePy, CLIP, BLIP, VideoMAE, Gemini Flash, Bark TTS

### [MLB Pitch Prediction App](https://github.com/HudsonFuller/TheBullpen)
* **Description:** Developed an app that uses a machine learning model to predict the outcome of a pitch based on its speed, spin, location, and other parameters.
* **My Contribution:** Used Flask to implement back-end logic with API routes and endpoints, and created SQLite database to store prediction history.
* **Tech:** Python, Flask, SQLite
  
### [Decoder-based Chess Bot](https://github.com/skkampshoff/DecoderChessBot)
* **Description:** Created ChessGPT, a decoder-based chess bot, to be used for the DSU's AI Club chess competition. Chess bot used a decoder-only transformer architecture in order to predict the next best move.
* **My Contribution:** Developed and refined the decoder class used by the bot. Also implemented edge case logic if the bot was unable to predict in a timely manner.
* **Tech:** Python, PyTorch

### [Parallel Merge Sort](https://github.com/skkampshoff/Parallel_Merge_Sort)
* **Description:** Created multiple versions of the merge sort algorithm and compared results with different numbers of threads and devices.
* **My Contribution:** Developed the sequential baseline version along with the parallel version that utilized Pthreads.
* **Tech:** C, Pthreads

### [Website Final Project](https://github.com/skkampshoff/Web-Development-Final-Project)
* **Description:** Website final project for Web Development showing a comprehensive variety of skills learned throughout the course.
* **My Contribution:** Designed multi-page website with full-stack architecture with a database managed by an API for user login/authentication.
* **Tech:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.JS, MySQL

### [Minesweeper Remake](https://github.com/skkampshoff/Minesweeper-Remake)
* **Description:** Minesweeper Remake with interactive Windows Form GUI and options for game difficulty and size.
* **My Contribution:** Integrated all game logic and GUI while following object-oriented design principles.
* **Tech:** C#, Windows Forms

## 🛠 Technical Skills
* **Languages:** Python, C++, C#, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, VBA
* **Frameworks:** ASP.NET, Flask, SQL Server, Git/GitHub, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
